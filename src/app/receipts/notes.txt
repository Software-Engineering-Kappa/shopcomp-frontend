from Home:
- pass receiptId to ReceiptSearch X
    - ReceiptSearch sets receiptId X
- pass receiptId to EditReceiptForm X
- EditReceiptForm calls getReceipt (/receipts/{receiptId}) to get receipt info X
    - receipt info then displayed
    - all info saved (in a reference?) to access for adding and deleting functions

FIRST:
- just get the passing, function signatures, and html down
- make mock APIs needed
- make sure that is good,
THEN:
- implement functions

Extra: clean up redudency in handlePress of other components setting receiptId when already set by the query useEffect hook
could also move interface type definitions like Receipt to own file
change receiptId in Receipt to just id

LEFT OFF AT: 
designing html for actual popup
- can probably reuse some of the custom inputs from CreateReceiptForm
- adding to the table dynamically with purchases, and organizing by category
    - should be done in a separate function
    - go through receipt.purchases and make a list (alphabetical?) of the categories
        - .forEach((p) => if (!categories.contains(p.category)) categories.add(p.category))
    - then for each category just .map((p) => if (p.category == currCategory)) 
        - maybe something like that

- need to make PurchaseRow
NOTE: not gonna do quantity, should adjust ad-item div to match

need to make buttons do things
change receiptId to id IF DOING THAT ALSO CHANGE IT IN THE LAMBDA FUNCTIONS!!!!!!!!!!

submit and edit should not show at the same time

currently doing:
- PurchaseRow and how to submit in submitPurchase
    - need to update actual list and whats displayed - maybe something like what was done in ReceiptSearch?

listPurchases: 
- can use `JOIN` with the various IDs to fetch all in one response rather than making four separate queries for each Purchase
- response body is undefined in the case of an error
- does page show all purchases across site or only those made by the shopper?

added/edited purchases will have an ID of -1
    when receipt is submitted, -1s will be looked for to call addPurchase on
deleted purchases will have an ID of -2
    when receipt is submitted, -2s will be looked for to call deletePurchase on

TODO currently: getReceipt wants to accept Receipt but is getting Purchase[] from the mock adapter
line 545 receiptId needs to be defined to display what is returned so should fix that issue hopefully

when receiptId is set on line 478 need to check that all fields within it are valid to ensure no fields undefined (or otherwise invalid format or range or whatever)
all fields as well as receipt itself need to not be undefined
should also check this before an edit is submitted (line 422)

Things left to do:
- submitReceipt
- deletePurchase
- addItem
